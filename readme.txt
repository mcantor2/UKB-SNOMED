These are mappings from the UK Biobank's field 20003 of self-reported medications.
The encoding list seems to be a mix of Read codes and free text. Because the medication list is old, many of the concepts that map exactly to the Read codes are now inactive.
This list maps to Snomed CT UK and International and the UMLS.
